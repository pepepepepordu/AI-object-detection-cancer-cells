# Cancer Cell Detection and Image Processing

This repository contains Python scripts for detecting and processing cancer cells from images using Roboflow and OpenCV. The scripts can be used detecting cancer cells:

How to Use
1. Prepare Your Images:
- For the cropping script, ensure that the images in the image_directory contain cancer cells.
- For the processing script, make sure the cropped images generated by the first script are stored in the cropped directory.

2.Execute the Scripts:
- Run the scripts by executing the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
 
  bash
  python crop_cells.py
  python process_cells.py

3. Review the Results:
- The cropped cancer cell images will be saved to the output directory youâ€™ve specified.
- Processed images will be organized into Cancer, Not Cancer, or Unsure folders based on the dot count results.


## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Numpy
- Roboflow API (`roboflow`)

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy roboflow
